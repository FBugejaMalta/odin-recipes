      <h3>Delicious Rabbit recipe</h3>
      <p>
        Cooking rabbit is similar to chicken, fry on a moderate heat for 20 minutes or so until the internal temperature reaches 71Â°C. Ideally, only quick-cook the lean, tender cuts of rabbit, such as the saddle or the loin - the other cuts are much more suited to pot roasting or braising.
